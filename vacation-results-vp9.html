<pre>Here is a plan for your trip to St. Petersburg, Florida:

**Flights:**
*   Look for budget-friendly flights from Philadelphia (PHL) to Tampa International Airport (TPA) for August 10-15, 2025. Airlines like American Airlines and United Airlines offer routes to Tampa. It's recommended to book in advance for the best prices.

**Accommodation:**
*   Search for a quiet Airbnb with a kitchen in St. Petersburg. Areas like the Historic Old Northeast are noted for their charm and quiet streets.

**Activities:**

*   **Yoga:**
    *   Consider attending a yoga class at SukhaLife Yoga, which has classes scheduled in August 2025. They also offer special events like Acoustic Candlelit Restorative Yoga.
    *   Blissfit Yoga offers classes on Upham Beach, St Pete Beach, FL, which could be a great option for a relaxed morning or late afternoon activity.
    *   Electric Body Yoga in St. Pete offers workshops, check their schedule for August.
    *   There are also beach yoga sessions available, such as those on St. Pete Beach.

*   **Whole Foods & Farmers Markets:**
    *   Whole Foods Market has a location in St. Petersburg at 201 38th Ave N.
    *   The Saturday Morning Market in Williams Park is a great place to find local produce and goods.

*   **Nature & Gardens:**
    *   **Sunken Gardens:** A beautiful botanical garden in St. Petersburg, open daily with admission.
    *   **Florida Botanical Gardens:** Located in Largo (a short drive from St. Petersburg), these gardens are open daily and free to the public, offering a walk through 150 acres of gardens.

*   **Sightseeing & Arts:**
    *   **The Dali Museum:** Immerse yourselves in the works of Salvador Dal√≠. The museum is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm, with extended hours until 8 pm on Thursdays. Consider visiting on a Thursday for potentially discounted tickets and fewer crowds.

*   **Beaches & Beach Culture:**
    *   St. Petersburg and the surrounding areas (like St. Pete Beach) offer numerous beaches to relax and enjoy the coastal atmosphere.

**Food:**
*   With your Airbnb's kitchen, you can take advantage of the local produce from farmers markets to cook healthy meals.
*   Explore local restaurants that offer whole food options.

**Itinerary Notes:**
*   Given your preference for early mornings and late afternoons for outdoor activities, plan your yoga, beach time, and garden visits accordingly.
*   The Dali Museum has later hours on Thursdays, which might fit your schedule well if you prefer to explore in the late afternoon.

This plan incorporates your interests in yoga, whole foods, sightseeing, beaches, botanical gardens, and a relaxed pace, while keeping your budget and accommodation preferences in mind.</pre>
